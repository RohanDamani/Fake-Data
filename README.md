# Fake-Data_Heroku-App

NodeJS Express server to serve fake data to test XHR requests/load data in my personal development projects.

Visit https://fake-data.herokuapp.com/ to examine the API and available routes.

Hosted on Heroku free dyno so there is a wake-up time latency, which can be useful for testing.
